relish(TM) is an application programming language which includes a simple  full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.

compiler and intermediate-code interpreter are GPLv3 and libraries for programmers are LGPL v3.

relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy.

The relish.pl domain was registered for the relish programming language on September 18, 2012. relish(TM) programming language source code, including its COPYING\_AND\_TRADEMARK notice and licenses, was first uploaded to code.google.com September 28, 2012, and the relish.pl website, implemented in the relish programming language, went live on October 21, 2012.
