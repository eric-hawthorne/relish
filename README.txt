relish(TM) state of the software warning - Sep. 27, 2012
========================================

This software is just being thrown into version control for the first time and is not quite ready for organized collaborative development: 

- It needs a proper test suite.

- The example relish programs and web app pages are ridiculously silly.

- There are a number of extra and spurious source code files leftover from Go compiler code. The relish compiler was morphed from the Go compiler in Go, as of a pre Go 1.0 version.

- There is no roadmap and issues list to guide development priorities.

- Installation and build and run instructions are missing.

- relish language documentation is missing.

All of these things will improve. Just don't say you weren't warned about the current messy and not ready for prime time state.

If you are interested at this early stage on working on it, best to contact me directly at relishpl___(AT)__gmail.com and we can discuss the easiest way to get started.
