		<dd>relish can download the proper versions of code libraries your program is dependent on automatically from the Internet - and all relish code comes with source code.</dd>
		
		<dt>model your domain quickly</dt>

	<h3>Technical Summary of Features</h3>
	<p>
	relish&#8482; is an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name 'rel'ish  comes from the language's inbuilt support of relations between datatypes. A programmer can define an entity-relation model in the language, then with concise syntax can associate objects according to the model relations, and conveniently traverse the network of related objects. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
	</p>
	<p>
	relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy.

	The relish compiler-interpreter is free software licensed with GPL version 3 and libraries for programmers are licensed with LGPL v3, meaning that programs written in relish need not themselves be licensed compatibly with the GPL. However, the relish runtime environment will only execute programs which have their source code present in a standard location.
