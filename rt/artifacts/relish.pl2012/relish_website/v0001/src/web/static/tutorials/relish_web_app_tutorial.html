 <meta name="description" content="Home page for relish(TM), an application programming language which includes a simple full-stack web application framework and transparent persistence. Focus is on simplicity and minimalism via very strict enforcement of conventions. The name comes from the language's inbuilt construct of relations between datatypes. A programmer can express an entity-relation model of the application domain directly in the language then associate instances. Methods are owned by tuples of datatypes, and are dispatched by multi-argument multimethod dispatch.
relish is implemented in Go, and inherits/wraps some Go features like goroutine concurrency and channels, but is almost entirely unlike Go in language constructs and philosophy." />

	<a name="BackgroundNeeded"><h3>Background Knowledge Needed to Use This Document</h3></a>
	This is not a tutorial intended to teach beginning programmers how to create their first web application. This tutorial is written for a programmer who is already familiar with the basics of and technical terminology of web application development and wants to understand how to develop web applications using the relish&#8482; full-stack web application development framework. For example, the reader may have some experience developing web applications with platforms such as Java EE, Python web frameworks, Ruby on Rails, PHP, or ASP.NET. 



	<a name="Definition"><h3>Working Definition of Web Application</h3></a>
	<p>
		For purposes of this tutorial, a web application is defined as a computer program, with persistent data storage, that uses web pages as its user interface, and/or provides a web services API to other applications. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The UI web pages may be simple HTML with HTML forms, or they may include client-side javascript for such purposes as:
		   <ul>
		   	<li>input validation,</li>
		   <li>content layout, interaction, or animation,</li>  
		   <li>AJAX asynchronous loading of page element content or data for the client-side,</li>
		   <li>AJAX asynchronous communication of user commands to the server.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<a name="RoleOfRelish"><h3>Role of relish in a Web Application</h3></a>
	<p>
		relish is for programming the server-side aspects of a web application:
		   <ul>
		   	<li>business logic</li>
		   	<li>domain data model</li>		   	
		   <li>data persistence and querying</li>  
		   <li>template-based dynamic web-page generation</li>
		   <li>JSON or XML responses to web service requests</li>
		   <li>static web-page or static image/media content serving</li>
		   <li>email message sending from application (if an SMTP server is available)</li>
		   <li>making http GET/POST requests to downstream web services</li>
		</ul>		
		relish does not replace client-side javascript programming, if such is needed for your application.

    <a name="RoleOfRelish"><h3>Changing Code and Restarting the Web Application</h3></a>
	<p>
         If you edit and change any of your .rel files in the application, you must shut down the web application (Ctrl-c),
         and then start the web application again by re-issuing the relish -web 8080 ... command.<br/>
         <em>Captain Obvious Tip: Shutting down is best done during at a moment in time when no web requests are being processed.</em> 
	</p>
	<p>
		You can modify html template files without shutting down the web application. Just reload the web page in the browser after changing the html template file.

			Here is a collection of simple relish&#8482; program examples. 
			</p>
			<p>
				 <span class="future">relish language features or built-in methods or standard library methods that are planned but not yet implemented are shown in text of this colour.</span>
				</p>				
				</p>
			<p>All relish programs must live in a file called some_filename.rel, which must be located in a package directory within a version directory of a relish software artifact directory. To execute an example program below, you would have to place it in a source code file in the right context. You would also have to give each code snippet a source code preamble, because all relish source code files must have some standard header information at the top of the file. Additionally, the snippet of code would have to be placed in a main function to run. 
			</p>
				<p>The purpose of these rules is to ensure interoperability of large codebases, and to ensure that code files are findable and self-explanatory.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each of the code examples excerpted below can be found in runnable form within the relish distribution directory structure, in the examples.relish.pl2012/simple_programs software artifact. This can be found in the relish/artifacts/ directory if you have a binary distribution of relish, or in the relish/rt/artifacts/ directory if you have a source distribution of relish. Running instructions: 1. cd to the artifacts directory. 2. Issue command e.g.: relish examples.relish.pl2012/simple_programs fibonacci
